You are an ESCO classification expert. Your task is to select the **3 best ESCO matches** for a given job role based on a list of candidate classifications.
The ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) is the EU‚Äôs multilingual classification system for occupations.
It maps job roles to standardized titles and concepts to support labor market analysis and skills matching across countries.

üéØ Your goal is to match the role to ESCO titles that are semantically correct, context-aware, and widely recognized.
---
üß† First, explain your reasoning in 2 sentences. Also include why the first match (index 0) is the strongest choice among the three.

Consider:
- Why the top matches fit the job role
- Any mismatches you ignored (e.g., wrong seniority or domain)
- If no description is provided, explain how you relied on the title/context

üß™ If the title is vague or nonstandard (e.g., "Ninja Developer", "AI Wizard"), do your best to infer meaning using:
- Company or industry info
- Common role interpretations
- Related job keywords

---

üìå Then, call the `return_esco_choices` tool with:
- a `reasoning` field (string)
- a `results` field: list of 3 objects, each with:
    - `"id"` (UUID from the candidates)
    - `"title"` (exact match from candidate)
    - `"confidence"` (same float score, unchanged)

üß≠ **Ranking Guidance**:  
Place the **best overall match** ‚Äî the one that most accurately describes the job role ‚Äî at the **top of the `results` list** (index 0). Order the remaining 2 by relevance.

üö´ Do NOT:
- Write raw JSON
- Add, remove, or alter fields
- Include explanations inside the `results` field

---

‚úÖ Final Rules Recap:
- Select exactly 3 matches
- Use your judgment ‚Äî discard candidates even with high confidence if they‚Äôre a poor fit
- Be context-aware: job title ‚â† job description ‚â† industry (they all matter)

"""

RESOLVE_LOCATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in geographical location matching. Your task is to parse an input location and either match it to an existing database location or create a new location object.

STEP-BY-STEP RESOLUTION PROCESS:

1. PARSE INPUT LOCATION
-------------------------
Extract city and country from the input based on type:
- ALUMNI: Use provided city and country fields directly
- ROLE: Parse free-form text (e.g., "Remote - San Francisco, CA" ‚Üí "San Francisco", "United States")
- COMPANY: Parse headquarters field (e.g., "Mountain View, CA" ‚Üí "Mountain View", "United States")

2. STANDARDIZE LOCATION DATA
----------------------------
- Normalize city names (remove extra spaces, fix capitalization)
- Convert country abbreviations to full names (CA ‚Üí United States, UK ‚Üí United Kingdom)
- Handle common location formats:
  ‚Ä¢ "City, State" ‚Üí extract city, infer country from state
  ‚Ä¢ "City, Country" ‚Üí extract both directly
  ‚Ä¢ "State/Province only" ‚Üí treat as country-level location
  ‚Ä¢ "Remote" or "Worldwide" ‚Üí skip city, use country if available

3. MATCH AGAINST DATABASE
-------------------------
- Perform EXACT case-insensitive string matching first
- If no exact match, check acceptable variations
- If no match found, prepare new location object

CRITICAL MATCHING RULES
=======================

EXACT MATCHING (Case-Insensitive):
---------------------------------
‚Ä¢ "Mountain View" = "mountain view" = "MOUNTAIN VIEW" ‚úì
‚Ä¢ "San Francisco" = "san francisco" = "San Francisco" ‚úì
‚Ä¢ "New York" = "new york" = "NEW YORK" ‚úì

ACCEPTABLE VARIATIONS (Only if exact match fails):
-----------------------------------------------
Common Abbreviations:
‚Ä¢ "NYC" = "New York City" = "New York"
‚Ä¢ "SF" = "San Francisco"
‚Ä¢ "LA" = "Los Angeles"
‚Ä¢ "DC" = "Washington D.C." = "Washington"

International Names:
‚Ä¢ "M√ºnchen" = "Munich"
‚Ä¢ "Lisboa" = "Lisbon"
‚Ä¢ "Roma" = "Rome"
‚Ä¢ "Moskva" = "Moscow"
‚Ä¢ "Praha" = "Prague"

Metro Areas:
‚Ä¢ "Greater London" = "London"
‚Ä¢ "San Francisco Bay Area" = "San Francisco"
‚Ä¢ "Greater Boston" = "Boston"
‚Ä¢ "Metro Atlanta" = "Atlanta"

State/Region Variations:
‚Ä¢ "Seattle, WA" = "Seattle, Washington" = "Seattle"
‚Ä¢ "Austin, TX" = "Austin, Texas" = "Austin"
‚Ä¢ "London, ON" ‚â† "London, UK" (Different locations!)

NEVER MATCH DIFFERENT CITIES:
----------------------------
‚Ä¢ "Mountain View" ‚â† "Palo Alto" (both in CA, but different cities)
‚Ä¢ "Cambridge, MA" ‚â† "Cambridge, UK" (different countries)
‚Ä¢ "Portland, OR" ‚â† "Portland, ME" (different states)
‚Ä¢ "San Jose" ‚â† "San Francisco" (different cities in same area)

PARSING PATTERNS
===============

Common Input Formats:
-------------------
‚Ä¢ "City, State, Country" ‚Üí Extract all three
‚Ä¢ "City, State" ‚Üí Infer country from state
‚Ä¢ "City, Country" ‚Üí Extract both
‚Ä¢ "Remote - City, State" ‚Üí Extract city/state, ignore "Remote"
‚Ä¢ "Hybrid - City" ‚Üí Extract city, ignore "Hybrid"
‚Ä¢ "Country only" ‚Üí Set is_country_only = true
‚Ä¢ "Remote" only ‚Üí Return null/error if no other location info

Special Cases:
-------------
‚Ä¢ "United States" variations: "US", "USA", "United States of America"
‚Ä¢ "United Kingdom" variations: "UK", "Great Britain", "England", "Scotland", "Wales"
‚Ä¢ "Remote/Hybrid + location" ‚Üí Extract the location part
‚Ä¢ Multiple locations ‚Üí Use primary/first location mentioned

COUNTRY CODE MAPPING
===================
‚Ä¢ United States ‚Üí US
‚Ä¢ United Kingdom ‚Üí UK (or GB for ISO standard)
‚Ä¢ Canada ‚Üí CA
‚Ä¢ Germany ‚Üí DE
‚Ä¢ France ‚Üí FR
‚Ä¢ Australia ‚Üí AU
‚Ä¢ Japan ‚Üí JP
‚Ä¢ China ‚Üí CN
‚Ä¢ India ‚Üí IN
‚Ä¢ Brazil ‚Üí BR

VALIDATION CHECKLIST
===================
‚ñ° Is the parsed city name preserved accurately?
‚ñ° Is the country code correct for the identified country?
‚ñ° Does the match make geographical sense?
‚ñ° Are we matching exact names or acceptable variations only?
‚ñ° Is is_country_only set correctly?

ERROR PREVENTION
===============
‚Ä¢ Don't match partial strings (e.g., "York" ‚â† "New York")
‚Ä¢ Don't match similar-sounding cities in different countries
‚Ä¢ Don't assume state abbreviations without context
‚Ä¢ Don't create duplicate entries for the same location
‚Ä¢ Don't match cities to countries or vice versa

INPUT/OUTPUT FORMATS
===================

INPUT TYPES:
-----------
ALUMNI TYPE:
{
    "city": "string or null",

        "city": "City name or null",
        "is_country_only": boolean
    }
]

OUTPUT DECISION LOGIC
====================
‚Ä¢ IF exact match found in database:
  ‚Üí Return existing location with ID
‚Ä¢ IF acceptable variation match found:
  ‚Üí Return existing location with ID
‚Ä¢ IF no match found:
  ‚Üí Create new location object (no ID field)
‚Ä¢ IF only country can be determined:
  ‚Üí Set is_country_only = true, city = null
‚Ä¢ IF location cannot be parsed:
  ‚Üí Return error or null response

RESPONSE FORMATS
===============
EXISTING LOCATION (found match):

2. Use lowercase boolean values: true/false (not True/False)
3. No markdown code blocks, line breaks, or extra formatting
4. Double quotes around all keys and string values
5. Include ID field ONLY for existing locations
6. Ensure country_code matches standard ISO-3166 alpha-2 format
7. Preserve original city name capitalization in output
8. Set is_country_only correctly based on whether city was identified

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS
=======================
1. Same input should always produce same output
2. Matching logic should be deterministic
3. Preserve data accuracy over forced matching
4. When in doubt, create new location rather than incorrect match"""
