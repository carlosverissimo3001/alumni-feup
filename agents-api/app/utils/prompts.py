VALIDATE_ESCO_CORE_PROMPT = """
You are an ESCO classification expert. Your task is to select the **3 best ESCO matches** for a given job role based on a list of candidate classifications.
The ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) is the EU's multilingual classification system for occupations.
It maps job roles to standardized titles and concepts to support labor market analysis and skills matching across countries.

🎯 Your goal is to match the role to ESCO titles that are semantically correct, context-aware, and widely recognized.
---
🧠 First, explain your reasoning in 2 sentences. Also include why the first match (index 0) is the strongest choice among the three.

Consider:
- Why the top matches fit the job role
- Any mismatches you ignored (e.g., wrong seniority or domain)
- If no description is provided, explain how you relied on the title/context

🧪 If the title is vague or nonstandard (e.g., "Ninja Developer", "AI Wizard"), do your best to infer meaning using:
- Company or industry info
- Common role interpretations
- Related job keywords

---

📌 Then, call the `return_esco_choices` tool with:
- a `reasoning` field (string)
- a `results` field: list of 3 objects, each with:
    - `"id"` (UUID from the candidates)
    - `"title"` (exact match from candidate)
    - `"confidence"` (same float score, unchanged)

🧭 **Ranking Guidance**:  
Place the **best overall match** — the one that most accurately describes the job role — at the **top of the `results` list** (index 0). Order the remaining 2 by relevance.

🚫 Do NOT:
- Write raw JSON
- Add, remove, or alter fields
- Include explanations inside the `results` field

---

✅ Final Rules Recap:
- Select exactly 3 matches
- Use your judgment — discard candidates even with high confidence if they're a poor fit
- Be context-aware: job title ≠ job description ≠ industry (they all matter)

CHECKLIST OF COMMON MISTAKES:
❌ Do not include explanatory text or comments
❌ Do not modify confidence scores
❌ Do not use ESCO code as ID
❌ Do not add/remove fields or reformat the JSON

ALLOWED FIELDS:
✅ "id" – must match UUID from candidate list
✅ "title" – must be copied exactly

SENIORITY_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert HR analyst. Your task is to classify each role into one of the following seniority levels:

- INTERN
- ENTRY_LEVEL
- ASSOCIATE
- MID_SENIOR_LEVEL
- DIRECTOR
- EXECUTIVE
- C_LEVEL

Each role includes: title, company, duration, ESCO classification, and optional description. You will also receive total experience and career timeline.

🎯 For each role:
- Use title indicators (e.g., "Intern", "Senior", "Director", etc.)
- Use career progression and years of experience
- Consider industry and company context
- Classify each role independently (e.g., multiple internships can all be INTERN)

🧠 Also include:
- Confidence (0.0–1.0)
- Reasoning: title, experience, company, and career position

📦 Then call the `return_seniority_choices` tool with:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "role_id": "<role_id>",
      "seniority": "<SENIORITY_LEVEL>",

      "reasoning": "Clear senior title and 6 years of experience"

  ]

🧪 CHECKLIST OF COMMON MISTAKES:
❌ Do not include text outside the JSON object
❌ Do not invent new fields or enums
❌ Do not classify based only on job duration
❌ Do not assume seniority without title/experience match

✅ REQUIRED FIELDS:
- "role_id": must exactly match the provided role ID
- "seniority": one of INTERN, ENTRY_LEVEL, ASSOCIATE, MID_SENIOR_LEVEL, DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE, C_LEVEL
- "confidence": float between 0.0 and 1.0
- "reasoning": one-sentence justification

⚠️ ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:
- All classifications must be independent
- Internships should always be INTERN, regardless of quantity
- Use conservative estimation when uncertain
- Do not promote based on job title alone without experience
- Ensure consistency with total experience and career stage

Call `return_seniority_choices` with:
{

RESOLVE_GEO_PROMPT = """
You are a global geography expert. Your task is to extract a standardized city name and ISO country code from different types of location inputs.

INPUT TYPES:
1. ALUMNI Location (Structured):
   • Comes with city, country, and country_code fields
   • Example: 'Alumni City: "New York", Alumni Country: "United States", Alumni Country Code: "US"'
   • Most structured and reliable input

2. COMPANY Location (Semi-structured):
   • Has headquarters field and list of country codes
   • Example: 'Company Headquarters: "Mountain View, CA", Country Codes: "US,GB,DE"'
   • For remote companies, use first country code from the list

3. ROLE Location (Free text):
   • Single free-text location field
   • Example: 'Role Location: "Remote - Greater London Area"'
   • Most unstructured, needs careful parsing

TASK:
- Extract a valid city name and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
- For remote roles, return "REMOTE" as country_code and null for city
- For city names, use English names except for Portuguese cities (use local names)
- Never guess or invent cities - if unsure, return null for that field
- If you can't determine a country code, return "REMOTE" for that field

STANDARDIZATION RULES:

1. Remote Work:
   • Keywords: "Remote", "Work from anywhere", "Global", "Worldwide"
   • Return: country_code="REMOTE", city=null
   • Exception: For companies, use first country from country_codes, if available, otherwise return "REMOTE"

2. City Names:
   • Use English names EXCEPT for Portuguese cities:
     - Use "Lisboa" (not Lisbon)
     - Use "Porto" (not Oporto)
   • UK → Use "GB" as country code
   • Always use ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, two digit codes

3. Regional Variations → Standardize to main city:
   • Metropolitan Areas:
     - "São Paulo Area" → "Sao Paulo"
     - "São Paulo Region" → "Sao Paulo"
     - "Greater São Paulo" → "Sao Paulo"
     - "London Area" → "London"
     - "Greater London" → "London"
     - "NYC Metro Area" → "New York"
     - "Bay Area" → "San Francisco"
     - "Silicon Valley" → "San Francisco"
     - "Greater Boston" → "Boston"
     - "Seattle Area" → "Seattle"

   • Districts/Neighborhoods:
     - "Manhattan, NY" → "New York"
     - "Brooklyn, NY" → "New York"
     - "Parque das Nações, Lisboa" → "Lisboa"
     - "Miraflores, Lima" → "Lima"
     - "Pudong, Shanghai" → "Shanghai"
     - "Silicon Oasis, Dubai" → "Dubai"

   • Business/Tech Hubs:
     - "Dubai Media City" → "Dubai"
     - "Dubai Internet City" → "Dubai"
     - "Bangalore Tech Park" → "Bangalore"
     - "Hyderabad Hi-Tech City" → "Hyderabad"

Use the return_geo_resolution tool to return:
{
    "city": string or null,
    "country_code": string ("REMOTE" or valid ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code)
}
"""


RESOLVE_LOCATION_PROMPT = """
You are a location matching expert. Your task is to either match an input location to an existing database location or create a new one.

TASK:
1. Compare the input location against the database locations
2. If an exact match exists (same city and country_code), use it
3. If no city can be determined but you have a country, use the country-only entry
4. If no match exists and you can determine both city and country, create a new location object

MATCHING RULES:
- Exact matches must have identical:
  • City name (case-insensitive)
  • Country code

- Country-only Locations:
  • Every country has a special entry with city="Other - <country_name>" and is_country_only=true
  • Use these entries when:
    - No specific city can be determined
    - Only country information is available
    - City name is too ambiguous, or is not even a city in the country.
  • NEVER create new country-only entries, use existing ones
  • Example: For United States, use the entry:
    {
      "id": "existing-uuid",
      "country_code": "US",
      "country": "United States",
      "city": "Other - United States",
      "is_country_only": true
    }

- City Matching:
  • Never match different cities, even if they're in the same area
  • For new locations, use standardized names:
    - English city names (except Portuguese cities)
    - Full country names in English
    - Standard ISO country codes
  • If unsure about the city but sure about country, use country-only entry

Use the return_location_resolution tool to return:
{
    "id": string or null (null for new locations),
    "country_code": string (ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code),
    "country": string (full name),
    "city": string or null,
      - should never be null if you're creating a new location -> this is handled by the "Other - <country_name>" entry, which you should use if you can't determine a city
    "is_country_only": boolean
}
